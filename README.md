# project-for-programming-class
This is a school project for my programming class, it is written in JavaScript, and the purpose was to create an endless runner where you are a helicopter and have to fly past obstacles. I have uploaded the code in this repository in case you want to see it and maybe add or improve it. If you do please leave the new code in the comments.

Happy Programming!
